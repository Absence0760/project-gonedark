# Going Dark *(working title)*

A mobile-first **RTS / FPS hybrid**. Command and grow your camps from above like
*Company of Heroes* — economy, territory, army-building, cover-and-suppression
tactics — then **drop into a single tank or trooper and fight in first person**.
The catch: while you're embodied, *the world goes dark*. You lose all sight of
the battlefield except what your unit can see. Stay in as long as you dare.

This repo holds the design, architecture, and roadmap, and — as of Phase 1 — the
**Rust engine workspace** (validated end-to-end on real arm64, D22; see Status). The
Phase 0/0.5 throwaway Godot prototypes that proved touch-feel and netcode feel have
been deleted on Phase 1 completion.

## The pitch in one line

> You are always the commander. Embodiment is a lens you put on — powerful, and
> blinding. The skill isn't whose AI plays better; it's *yours*: how well you set
> your army up before you dive, and whether you can read the board well enough to
> know when it's safe to go dark.

## The core loop

1. **Command** (top-down RTS) — build and upgrade camps, manage economy, train an
   army, capture territory, issue orders and stances to your units.
2. **Embody** (FPS) — possess any one of your living units. Your skill with that
   tank or soldier is now in play: precise aim, peeking cover, clutch moments the
   AI literally cannot do.
3. **Go dark** — the moment you embody, the strategic map blacks out. You see only
   what your unit sees. Thin alerts ("base under attack") are your one thread back.
4. **Surface** — pull out when you dare, or die and get ejected back to command.
   Re-read the changed board fast, re-issue orders, pick your next moment.

## What makes it different

Most RTS/FPS hybrids either split the two roles across different players
(*Eximius*, *Natural Selection 2*) or make the unit AI smart enough that leaving
your army alone is safe (which quietly lets the game play itself). **Going Dark
does neither.** One player does both jobs, the AI is a deliberately *literal*
order-executor, and embodiment costs you your sight. That turns information into
the game's real currency and makes "can I afford to be blind right now?" the
central, skill-based decision.

See [`docs/game-design.md`](docs/game-design.md) for the full design and
[`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md) for *why* each rule is the way it is.

| `Cargo.toml` + `core/ pal/ render/ engine/ pal-desktop/ pal-android/ app/ sim-runner/ net-sim-runner/ viz-runner/ server/` | **The Rust engine workspace.** `core` = deterministic fixed-point sim (zero platform deps) — a real flow field, the Phase 2 game-systems modules (`combat`/`terrain` cover+LoS, `territory`, `economy`/camps (Camp + Barracks; Rifleman/Heavy/Tank/Medic with production routing, [D65](docs/decisions.md)), `heal` (Medic heal-over-time, [D65](docs/decisions.md)), `resupply` (all-unit ammo rearm at a friendly Camp/Barracks — the logistics half of finite carried ammo, [D67](docs/decisions.md)), `fog`, `orders`, `alerts`, `event`), the scripted enemy `commander` that issues player-equivalent orders through the normal command path while units stay literal executors ([D39](docs/decisions.md)), the deterministic `rng` + fixed-point `trig` (LUT) + render-state `snapshot` substrate, the sans-I/O `lockstep` command-exchange loop + wire codec with runtime cross-client checksum-agreement (peers exchange per-tick checksums to catch a live desync, [D27](docs/decisions.md)), and the authoritative-snapshot `persist` serializer (`Sim::serialize/deserialize` sharing the checksum field-walk, terrain by map-id, for reconnect/resume — [D28](docs/decisions.md)) plus the `reconnect` resume policy (snapshot + buffered-command replay) and RTT-adaptive lockstep delay (the agreed `DelayChange` protocol, Phase 3 B7), a deterministic `spatial` hash backing near-O(1) target acquisition (bit-identical to the old brute-force scan, Phase 3 A5), and the **checksum-excluded** `detection` "gone-dark" tell (a pure derivation like `fog`/`alerts`: `Hidden|Subtle|Marked`, default Subtle — [D33](docs/decisions.md)), all fixed-point (sim-state modules checksum-folded; `fog`/`alerts`/`detection` are excluded derivations) ([D23](docs/decisions.md)), plus the **GPU-free, logic-free** `shell`↔sim seam — the `core::shell` façade (intent in, presentation-safe view out: match lifecycle/`MatchSummary`, the order-stance vocabulary as data, lockstep `ConnectionStatus`, and the embodiment-fair `InSessionView` that takes already-derived fog/alerts/tells, never `&World`) every app shell reaches `core` through, native or in-engine ([D32](docs/decisions.md)/[D34](docs/decisions.md)); and `scenario` — named deterministic scene seeders: the debug sandboxes `seed_duel` (two-tank hitbox duel) + `seed_infantry` (hitscan range/cone/cover/LoS sandbox), and the first **real playable match** `seed_skirmish` (two operational bases, one starting troop each, three neutral capture posts; small scenario-local purse, D30 balance untouched) — consumed by the headless runners and `engine::Game::new_scene` (dispatched via `app --scene <name>`; the desktop host boots `skirmish` by default); `pal` = platform traits (incl. the touch-UI input intents, the `Audio` mix seam, [D24](docs/decisions.md), and the `Transport` opaque-byte-frame netcode seam, [D27](docs/decisions.md)) plus `pal::mix` — the one shared, host-tested audio *render* math (pan/gain/muffle/sum) every backend mixes through ([D29](docs/decisions.md)); `render` = real `wgpu` instanced renderer with fog-of-war filtering, the embodied directional alert HUD (`fog`/`hud`, [D24](docs/decisions.md)), a white selection rim ([D26](docs/decisions.md)), a cooked greybox-mesh loader (`render::mesh` + `mesh.wgsl`, [D44](docs/decisions.md)) that `include_bytes!`s the Blender-cooked `.mesh` (GDM1) files, uploads them to GPU, and draws them through one shared depth-tested 3D pass — the embodied first-person **weapon viewmodel** and the command-view **3D unit/structure tokens** (with the 2D health/selection/ring quads layered on top as UI decals), and the Android-only on-screen FPS touch HUD screen-space pass (`render::touch_controls`, [D51](docs/decisions.md)), a selection-contextual command panel (`render::command_panel`, [D62](docs/decisions.md)), a command-view gone-dark tell overlay (`render::detection` + `detection.wgsl`, [D33](docs/decisions.md)), and a dev debug overlay (`render::debug` + `debug.wgsl`) drawn command-view-only behind `Game::debug_hitboxes` (F3, on in debug scenes) — tanks get armour-facet hitbox rings + tracers, infantry get range-ring + firing-cone wedge, all units get Player→Enemy LoS connectors + a muzzle-flash marker when firing — as a pure presentation derivation, never the dark embodied frame (invariant #6); `engine` = the platform-agnostic game loop (sim+render+fixed-tick+cameras+command/embodiment) that both hosts drive ([D20](docs/decisions.md)), also driving the embodied audio mix, unit selection, the order/stance command vocabulary (`audio`/`selection`/`command_ui`, [D24](docs/decisions.md)), embodied locomotion + hitscan firing (`locomote`/`fire`, [D50](docs/decisions.md)/[D51](docs/decisions.md)), the command-view production-panel seams (`build_ui`/`train_ui`/`upgrade_ui`, [D42](docs/decisions.md)–[D48](docs/decisions.md)), the in-engine `session_shell` ([D34](docs/decisions.md)), balance `tuning` ([D30](docs/decisions.md)), the RTT-estimator host seam (`net_tuning` — feeds `Lockstep::propose_delay` via `Game::observe_rtt`, [D27](docs/decisions.md)), and the pure host-tested touch seam that maps raw `InputFrame.touches` to embodied intents + HUD geometry (`touch_controls`, [D51](docs/decisions.md)), the selection-contextual command panel derivation (`command_panel_view`, [D62](docs/decisions.md)), and the scene-dispatch entry (`new_scene`/`debug_hitboxes` — `app --scene <name>` routes to `core::scenario` seeders; F3 toggles the per-scene debug overlay, on by default in the duel and infantry scenes), with the fixed-tick loop now sourcing each tick's command set through `core::lockstep` (single-player = a 1-peer delay-0 session, [D27](docs/decisions.md)); `pal-desktop` = real `winit`+`wgpu` backend with optional `cpal` audio output (opt-in `audio` feature → `pnpm play:audio`, [D26](docs/decisions.md)) plus `pal::Transport` backends — an in-process `LoopbackTransport` for dev/test and a real-socket `UdpTransport` (UDP now, QUIC the documented future, [D27](docs/decisions.md)); `app` = thin winit desktop host; `pal-android` = JNI/cargo-ndk backend whose `android_main` drives the same `engine` loop (builds an arm64 APK), with a real low-latency **AAudio** sink via `oboe` ([D29](docs/decisions.md)); `sim-runner` = headless single-client checksum driver, now also home to the deterministic **balance-metrics harness** (`--metrics[=open-duel|cover-duel|equal-cost|economy|summary]`: time-to-kill / equal-cost-trade / suppression-pin / economy-ramp series to **stderr**, stdout checksum stream untouched — the objective signal the [D30](docs/decisions.md) combat/economy re-tune was measured against), and a `duel` scene mode (headless hitbox-validation harness driven by `core::scenario::seed_duel`) and an `infantry` scene mode (hitscan scene driven by `core::scenario::seed_infantry`); `net-sim-runner` = headless **2-peer lockstep** checksum driver — runs both `core::lockstep` peers in-process over a seeded channel, asserts they agree + match a no-network reference, emits the agreed stream for the ADD-ONLY `compare-net` CI job (`pnpm desktop:sim:net`, [D27](docs/decisions.md)); `viz-runner` = headless **offscreen render** smoke test (renders `Game` to a texture, reads pixels back, asserts the command view draws + embodiment goes dark + the alert HUD draws, and writes PNGs — `pnpm desktop:viz`, needs a GPU so it's local-only, not CI); `server` = the Phase 4 backend scaffolding (WS-D) — telemetry ingest, a consent gate, and live-ops endpoints over an `axum` HTTP listener (`telemetry`/`consent`/`liveops`/`http`); pre-production, not yet wired to real infra. See [`docs/plans/phase-1-plan.md`](docs/plans/phase-1-plan.md) |

## Status

**Phase 1 — DONE (D22). Phase 2 (game systems) — SIGNED OFF systems-complete (D31). Phase 3
(scale & net) — lockstep + cross-client checksum agreement, `core::persist`/`reconnect`, and the
`spatial` index have landed. A playability push (D37–D40) turned the systems into an end-to-end
playable loop (command-and-grow UI, embodied FPS combat, win/lose, a scripted enemy commander),
and Phase 4 app-shell work is in flight (boot/title D35/D36, server telemetry/consent/live-ops
scaffolding, in-session + post-match shell); embodied FPS controls, 3D greybox assets, and
avatar-visible unit rendering run through D52.** Phase 0 (D14) and Phase 0.5
(D15) both passed (2026-06-23): touch-feel and embodied-combat-over-lockstep risks retired.
**Phase 1 exit criterion met on Galaxy S24, Adreno 750:** `pnpm android:checksum` confirmed
the device sim-runner checksum stream **bit-identical** to desktop over 300 ticks
(`4c34c6b5951edf57`); the `adb logcat` FPS heartbeat showed **120 fps** sustained at the locked
**60 Hz** sim tick — demonstrating sim/render decoupling (invariant #4) live on hardware. One
unit moves via a real deterministic flow field; tap-to-move works; the two-finger embody toggle
flips the world dark. The Rust engine workspace carries: a deterministic fixed-point `core`
(Q16.16 [D17](docs/decisions.md), hand-rolled SoA ECS [D18](docs/decisions.md)), the PAL trait
boundary, a real `wgpu` 29 + `winit` 0.30 renderer + `pal-desktop`/`pal-android` backends
([D19](docs/decisions.md)), and the shared `engine::Game` loop ([D20](docs/decisions.md)) that
both hosts drive. All three decide-first gates locked — sim rate closed by
[D21](docs/decisions.md): **global 60 Hz** (`core::sim::TICK_HZ = 60`; dual-rate deferred to
Phase 3). The **Unity/Godot fallback ([D8](docs/decisions.md)) is retired**; the custom Rust
engine is committed. **Honest caveat:** validated on a flagship; frame-rate/thermal on mid-range
silicon and the 200-unit power budget are Phase 3.

Target platforms: **Windows, Linux, Android, iOS** — one shared deterministic core with
platform-optimized backends (D3D12/Vulkan, Vulkan, Vulkan, Metal), developed on Linux desktop
first and shipping Android-first. See [`docs/platforms.md`](docs/platforms.md). Engine:
**custom native in Rust** (renderer via `wgpu`) — see [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md)
D10 for the reasoning.

## Local development

A fresh clone runs against local Docker services with committed, non-secret defaults —
no cloud access or secrets needed:

```
docker compose up -d        # Postgres + Redis (backend deps)
cargo run                   # loads .env.development   (once engine code exists)
```

Production secrets are KMS-encrypted (sops) in the separate private estate repo
(`~/github/infra-secrets/gonedark/`, **not** in this repo — see D12) and cloud infra is
Terraform in `infra/` — neither is touched for local work. Full details in
[`docs/infrastructure.md`](docs/infrastructure.md).
