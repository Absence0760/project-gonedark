//! Command-view **multi-touch gesture** seam — the RTS half's pan / zoom / embody grammar on a
//! touchscreen. The PURE, host-testable twin of the embodied [`touch_controls`](crate::touch_controls):
//! it turns the raw two-finger touch set the command view already receives into the three
//! command-layer intents the engine already consumes — a **pan** (`InputFrame::move_axis`), a **zoom**
//! (`InputFrame::scroll`), and a one-shot **embody** edge (`InputFrame::embody_pressed`).
//!
//! ## Why it lives here, not in `pal-android`
//! An Android `MotionEvent` can't be constructed in a host `cargo test`, so — exactly like
//! `touch_controls` — the platform backend does the dumb part (forward the currently-down pointers as
//! [`TouchSample`](gonedark_pal::TouchSample)s + a monotonic timestamp) and ALL the disambiguation
//! logic lives here as a pure state machine over `(touches, now_ms)`. Desktop never feeds it (it uses
//! the mouse-wheel + edge-pan), so this seam never runs there.
//!
//! ## The grammar (the bug it fixes)
//! Before this seam the backend's ONLY multi-touch gesture was "two fingers down = embody", gated on
//! `pointer_count >= 2` alone — so the natural pinch-to-zoom / two-finger-pan a player reaches for on
//! a map **hijacked embody**, and there was no way to pan or zoom the command camera at all. This seam
//! decomposes a two-finger gesture into its orthogonal parts each frame:
//!
//! - **PAN** — the two-finger *centroid* translating drives [`move_axis`](CommandGestureOutput::move_axis)
//!   from the per-frame centroid delta (the same host screen convention the WASD/edge-pan stick uses:
//!   `+x` right, `+y` down), fed to the command camera's `pan_focus`.
//! - **PINCH/ZOOM** — the *inter-finger distance* changing drives
//!   [`scroll`](CommandGestureOutput::scroll) from the per-frame spread delta (fingers apart = zoom IN
//!   = positive scroll, matching the wheel), fed to `zoom_half_extent`.
//! - **EMBODY** — a genuine two-finger **tap** (both fingers down AND back up within
//!   [`TAP_MAX_MS`], with total movement under [`TAP_SLOP_PX`], and never more than two fingers) raises
//!   the one-shot [`embody`](CommandGestureOutput::embody) edge. A pan or a pinch moves too far / holds
//!   too long, so it can NEVER be mistaken for the embody tap (the mis-tap resistance, P1-4).
//!
//! Pan and pinch are emitted together (they are orthogonal — a pure translation changes the centroid
//! but not the spread, a pure pinch the reverse), each behind a small deadzone so finger jitter in one
//! axis can't leak into the other. That decomposition IS the disambiguation.
//!
//! ## Where the outputs go (all host presentation, never the sim)
//! `move_axis` / `scroll` / `embody_pressed` are consumed by the engine **only in the command view**
//! (`Game::frame` gates the camera pan/zoom on `!embodied`, and `map_input_commands` no-ops embody
//! while already embodied), so it is harmless that this seam keeps tracking the twin-stick fingers
//! while embodied — those fields are ignored there. Floats are fine (host-side input/presentation, the
//! platform side of the PAL seam); nothing here touches `core` or the per-tick checksum (invariants
//! #1/#2/#7). The mapping *scales* ([`PAN_GAIN`], [`PINCH_GAIN`]) are a first-cut device feel and are
//! owed an on-device tuning pass; the *classification* (pan vs pinch vs tap) is what this seam locks.
