/**
 * Pure data + logic for the Android campaign mission-select / briefing surface — the native twin of
 * the desktop egui campaign screens (`app/src/shell.rs`). **No Android / Compose types** so it is
 * unit-testable on the plain JVM (`src/test`, no device), exactly like [BuildStamp.kt]: the
 * composables are device-gated chrome (D32) and exempt, but any real logic still gets a test
 * (CLAUDE.md testing rule), so the data model and the difficulty cycle live here, away from the UI.
 *
 * ## Rust mirror — keep in lock-step (D79 mirrored-constants discipline)
 *
 * [Difficulty] mirrors `core::campaign::Difficulty` (the **four-tier** campaign progression type —
 * `Recruit, Regular, Veteran, Elite`, NOT the three-tier `core::mission_tuning::Difficulty` the
 * commander reads): same variants, same ascending order, the same integer [tier] ranks (`0..=3`),
 * the same stable [id] strings, and the same wrapping cycle as the desktop's `shell::next_difficulty`
 * (`Recruit → Regular → Veteran → Elite → Recruit`). These are **mirrored constants** — if the Rust
 * side changes (a tier added/renamed, an id string changed), this file must change in the same commit
 * or the two shells silently disagree. The [CampaignModelTest] pins the id strings and the cycle so a
 * drift trips a test rather than shipping.
 *
 * [campaignNodes] mirrors `engine::mission_registry::default_campaign()`: today exactly **one**
 * playable node — the WS-A *Seize* mission ("10 troops, take the base"). Integration (not this file)
 * resolves a node's [MissionNode.sceneToken] to a real launchable scene and wires the
 * Campaign → MissionSelect → Briefing → gunsmith flow; this model only names the mission.
