# Decision Log

Lightweight ADR-style record of the design choices locked in during pre-production,
and *why*. Newest decisions at the bottom. Open forks live in
[`open-questions.md`](open-questions.md).

---

## D1 — One player does both roles (not asymmetric commander + soldiers)

**Decision:** A single player is both the RTS commander and the FPS avatar, switching
between them — *not* the *Eximius* / *Natural Selection* model where the commander and
the soldiers are different people.

**Why:** The whole intended tension — opportunity cost, divided attention — only
exists if the *same* person owns both jobs. Splitting them across players removes the
core decision.

---

## D2 — Divided attention is the skill; the AI does not delegate

**Decision:** Command and embodiment are mutually exclusive in time. You cannot do
both at once.

**Why:** This is the game's primary skill expression — the macro/micro attention
split of high-level RTS, cranked to the extreme (embodying means *zero* command for
that whole duration).

---

## D3 — Unit AI is a literal executor, not a smart autopilot

**Decision:** Units hold their last order + a simple stance and do exactly that —
nothing more. No autonomous strategic decisions.

**Why:** Smart autopilot quietly lets the game play itself and makes "whose AI is
better" the contest instead of player skill. Dumb, obedient AI means leaving your
army is a *real* risk, which is the point. Bonus: it's cheaper and more deterministic
to build than smart LOD AI.

**Consequence:** Design depth moves into the **order/stance vocabulary** (patrol
routes, engagement ranges, retreat triggers, trigger zones, queued production) — that
is the intended home for "smart play": the human's planning, not the machine's
reactions.

---

## D4 — Switching is cheap; the absence is expensive

**Decision:** Entering/leaving a unit is fast and smooth. The cost of embodiment is
*time away from command*, never UI friction.

**Why:** Clunky menus are fake difficulty. The intended cost is opportunity cost; the
transition itself should never be the obstacle.

**Corollary:** Embodiment must be *mechanically better* at the local fight than AI
control, or players won't accept the cost and the FPS layer becomes a dead novelty.

---

## D5 — Pure opportunity cost: stay as long as you dare

**Decision:** No hard timer, fuel gauge, or cooldown forcing you out of a unit. You
stay embodied as long as you choose.

**Why:** It's the most elegant and most punishing option. The bound is emergent (risk
of death + neglect), not an artificial mechanic.

---

## D6 — Death is a demotion, not a game-over

**Decision:** Dying while embodied ejects you back to the command view. No FPS respawn
timer, no spectator downtime. You then pick a *different* living unit to embody. The
unit you were driving is gone for good.

**Why:**
- Zero dead time — death drops you into a fully active RTS, never an idle wait.
- Self-balancing — overstaying gets you killed, which costs you the unit *and* dumps
  you into a neglected base. Greed is auto-punished.
- Makes the embodied unit precious (you lose it permanently), tying the risk into the
  army economy.
- **Big tech win:** you always respawn as the commander, so there is **no FPS respawn
  system to build** — the avatar is just whichever entity you're currently driving,
  not a persistent character with lives. Deletes a pile of state/netcode complexity.

**Consequence — comeback loop:** if your whole army dies you're stripped to pure
base-builder until you produce a new embodiable unit. That's the intended low point.

---

## D7 — While embodied, the world goes dark (blind, not informed)

**Decision:** Embodiment reverts the player's vision to *avatar-only*. You do **not**
keep strategic map vision. (Chosen over the "informed dread" alternative where you
keep passive map sight and watch helplessly.)

**Why:** Turns information into the game's real currency. The central skill becomes
*"can I afford to be blind right now?"* — reading the board before you dive. The blind
version makes "stay as long as you dare" genuinely tense because you don't even know
what you're sacrificing.

**Guardrails (so it's fair, not robbery):**
- **Alerts, not intel** — a thin thread back: directional flash + audio ("base under
  attack"), telling you *something* is wrong but not what/how bad.
- **Audio is a primary system** — strategic-layer sound bleeds into the embodied mix;
  you *hear* your empire when you can't see it.
- **Visceral, constant feedback** — vignette / darkened edges so the cost is always
  *felt*; the player must own every death as "I stayed too long."

**Tech note:** this is a vision-culling toggle in the presentation layer, not a sim
change — it cannot cause desyncs and needs no special pause machinery.

---

## D8 — Pre-production is design-only; engine direction is custom-native with a live fallback

> **Language resolved in [D10](#d10--engine-language-rust): Rust.** The "C++ or Rust"
> openness below is superseded; the rest of D8 stands.

**Decision:** Target Android-first (arm64-v8a, Vulkan 1.1). Lead direction is a custom
native engine (C++20 or Rust — a performance wash; decide on engineering values).
Keep Unity DOTS / Godot+GDExtension as a live fallback until the vertical slice is
validated on real hardware.

**Why:** The RTS ceiling (deterministic many-agent sim in a fixed budget) needs
cache-line control that managed runtimes abstract away — but the build cost is real,
so we don't burn the fallback until Phase 1 proves the slice. See
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md) and [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md).

---

## D9 — Four platforms: one shared deterministic core, platform-optimized backends

**Decision:** Ship on **Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS**. The game architecture (ECS,
deterministic fixed-point sim, game systems, AI, netcode) is **identical on every
platform**; only the **platform backend** (GPU API, audio, windowing, input, storage)
and the **presentation tier** (resolution, effects, refresh, controls) are optimized
per device — native paths: **D3D12/Vulkan on Windows, Vulkan on Linux, Vulkan 1.1 on
Android, Metal on iOS.** Develop on Linux desktop first; ship Android-first.

**Why:** "Optimized per device" must mean *native backends*, not *forked game logic*.
Forking the core would (1) kill cross-platform lockstep — deterministic play requires
every client to run the *same* sim — and (2) turn one game into four to maintain. The
float-free fixed-point sim already produces bit-identical results across x86-64 and
arm64, so cross-play across all four platforms is achievable *for free* — provided the
per-tick checksum CI runs across the whole platform/compiler/arch matrix from day one.

**Consequences:**
- A **Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL)** boundary is enforced from Phase 0; the core
  carries zero platform dependencies (`winit` collapses most of the non-GPU PAL).
- The renderer talks to one **RHI** — `wgpu` (native Vulkan/D3D12/Metal per device)
  hits all four targets with no per-platform renderer. *(This was a decisive factor in
  later choosing Rust as the engine language — see [D10](#d10--engine-language-rust).)*
- iOS carries the most external friction (macOS build host, signing, review, Metal) and
  is sequenced last.

See [`platforms.md`](platforms.md) for the full plan.

## D10 — Engine language: Rust

**Decision:** Build the engine in **Rust**, not C++. Resolves the language question left
open in [D8](#d8--pre-production-is-design-only-engine-direction-is-custom-native-with-a-live-fallback).
Renderer via **`wgpu`** (native Vulkan/D3D12/Metal, auto-selected per device); ECS via a
mature crate (Bevy/hecs/legion) or hand-rolled; FFI to Kotlin/JNI (Android) and
Swift/Obj-C (iOS) for platform services.

**Why:** Performance is a wash (both are LLVM-native), so the call is on engineering
values over a long horizon — and for *this* project (greenfield, small/AI-assisted team,
custom-native, mobile+desktop, determinism-critical) Rust's strengths hit the load-
bearing needs while its weaknesses miss them:

- **Cross-platform GPU is solved by `wgpu`** — native backends per device, which is
  exactly the D9 goal. C++ would mean hand-rolling an RHI or adopting The Forge/bgfx.
- **Fearless concurrency.** The deterministic lockstep sim is heavily threaded (job
  system, parallel culling/pathfinding/AI). Its worst bugs are silent, non-reproducible
  data races and determinism leaks. Rust eliminates that entire class at compile time —
  a correctness guarantee C++ cannot give. This is the decisive factor.
- **Determinism is more enforceable** via the type system (newtype fixed-point, no
  implicit float conversions, no UB, no uninitialized reads).
- **Toolchain simplicity** — `cargo` vs CMake + vcpkg/Conan + per-platform toolchains;
  compounds across four platforms over years.

**The maturity question, answered:** Rust's remaining gaps don't intersect this project.
- *Engine-code hot-reload* (no stable ABI) — the one real cost; mitigated by doing
  game-feel iteration in scripting/data + the automated build loop (roadmap). Architect
  a reloadable module only if it hurts.
- *Commercial middleware / hiring pool / console toolchains* — not load-bearing for a
  custom-native, mobile+desktop, small-team project; platform services cross into
  Kotlin/Swift via FFI regardless of engine language.

**When this should be revisited:** if priorities shift to shipping in ~6 months, hiring a
C++-veteran team, targeting consoles, or building on a commercial engine/middleware
stack — none currently true.

**Consequences:**
- The risk to actively manage is **engine-iteration speed** — lean on scripting/data hot-
  reload and the automated edit→build→test loop.
- iOS scripting caveat stands: no JIT, so any embedded VM (e.g. Lua) runs interpreted.
- Architecture/platforms docs now treat Rust as the language; C++ remains a noted
  fallback only if D10 is ever reversed.

## D11 — Local-first dev (Docker + committed defaults); prod secrets via sops; infra via Terraform

**Decision:** Three locked conventions for config, services, and secrets:
- **Clone-and-run local development.** `.env.development` is committed with safe,
  non-secret defaults; local services (Postgres, Redis) run via Docker (`compose.yaml`).
  A fresh clone runs with no cloud access, no secrets, no manual config. Personal
  overrides go in gitignored `.env.local`.
- **Production secrets in `./infra-secrets/`, KMS-encrypted with sops.** Only
  `*.sops.yaml` (ciphertext) is committable; `.gitignore` blocks all plaintext in that
  directory. Consumed by Terraform via the `carlpett/sops` provider (`data "sops_file"`
  → `local.secrets[...]`), or decrypt-to-tfvars as the alternative.
- **All cloud infrastructure is Terraform** (`infra/`), in this project's own AWS
  account + estate baseline; tfenv-pinned (1.15.0). No click-ops.

**Why:** Clone-and-run removes the credential dance from every contributor's (and AI
agent's) first experience, which compounds over the project's life. Encrypted-by-default
secrets + Terraform-only infra make the prod path auditable, reproducible, and safe to
keep in git — matching the rest of the personal estate.

**Estate caveat:** the global convention keeps prod secrets in the *separate private*
`Absence0760/infra-secrets` repo, not in (often public) project repos. This project
keeps them in-repo per the explicit `./infra-secrets` instruction; KMS encryption makes
that safe (same pattern meryl-green-designs uses). If this repo is published and shipping
ciphertext is undesirable, lift `infra-secrets/` into the private repo and re-point
`infra/secrets.tf` — nothing else changes.

**Status:** scaffolding ahead of code (no backend/services exist yet). The conventions
and `.gitignore` guards are in place so nothing is retrofitted. See
[`infrastructure.md`](infrastructure.md), [`../infra/README.md`](../infra/README.md).

> **Superseded in part by [D12](#d12--production-secrets-move-to-the-private-estate-repo-not-in-repo).**
> The secrets-*location* bullet ("in `./infra-secrets/`") no longer holds: secrets moved
> to the separate private estate repo. The clone-and-run, Terraform-only, and
> encrypted-by-default conventions stand.

## D12 — Production secrets move to the private estate repo (not in-repo)

**Supersedes:** the secrets-*location* portion of [D11](#d11--local-first-dev-docker--committed-defaults-prod-secrets-via-sops-infra-via-terraform).
Everything else in D11 stands unchanged.

**Decision:** This project's KMS-encrypted production secrets live in the **separate
private estate repo** `Absence0760/infra-secrets` (checked out at `~/github/infra-secrets/`,
a sibling of this repo), under a `gonedark/` subdirectory — **not** in a
`./infra-secrets/` folder inside this repo. The in-repo folder created by D11 is deleted.
Terraform's `carlpett/sops` data source now reads
`${path.module}/../../infra-secrets/gonedark/prod.sops.yaml`. The estate repo's
`.sops.yaml` gains a `^gonedark/.*\.sops\.yaml$` rule keyed to `alias/gonedark-sops`
(this project's own KMS key), and encrypts **every value** (no `encrypted_regex`) —
strictly safer than the per-key regex the in-repo `.sops.yaml` used.

**Why:** D11 kept secrets in-repo and justified it by citing "the explicit
`./infra-secrets` instruction" and the meryl-green-designs precedent. Both are weak: the
"instruction" traced back to this project's own earlier docs (circular), and meryl
committing its `*.sops` into a *public* repo is the exact anti-pattern the estate is
**migrating off**, not a model to copy. The global estate convention is
defense-in-depth — GitHub *private-repo* access control **and** KMS — and this game repo
is likely to be made public. Even though KMS ciphertext is safe to expose, shipping it
from a public repo throws away one of the two layers for no benefit. One subdir per
project in the shared private repo is the established estate shape (`flakey/`,
`running/`), so gonedark now matches it.

**Cost of the move:** near zero — no real secrets existed yet, so nothing had to be
re-encrypted. It was a scaffolding + path + docs change: repoint `infra/secrets.tf`,
delete the in-repo folder, drop its `.gitignore` block, and update cross-references.

**Status:** done, ahead of any backend code. `~/github/infra-secrets/gonedark/` holds
`prod.sops.yaml.example` (template) and the `.sops.yaml` rule with a placeholder ARN;
the real `alias/gonedark-sops` key + encrypted `prod.sops.yaml` get created when
`new-project-account.sh gonedark` runs and the backend needs its first secret. See
[`infrastructure.md`](infrastructure.md), [`../infra/README.md`](../infra/README.md),
and the estate repo's own `README.md` (`~/github/infra-secrets/README.md`).

## D13 — Monetization: cosmetic-only (weapon & player/unit skins)

**Decision:** The game monetizes **only through cosmetics** — weapon skins and
player/unit skins. **No pay-to-win:** nothing purchasable touches stats, balance, or
capability. Cosmetics are **presentation-layer only** and never enter the simulation.

**Why:**
- It's the one revenue path that doesn't corrode the competitive core. The entire design
  is a fairness argument — literal-executor AI (D3), "going dark" must read as *"I stayed
  too long"* (D7), divided attention as the only skill (D2). Pay-to-win detonates all of
  it. Skins sell **identity, not advantage.**
- It rides the decoupled sim/render split for free: a skin is a render-asset swap, so it
  *cannot* affect determinism or lockstep (invariants #1, #4). Monetization adds no sim
  surface area.

**Guardrails (non-negotiable — so cosmetics can't become pay-to-win by accident):**
- **Sim-identical.** A skin must never change hitbox, collision, unit
  silhouette/footprint/size, or readability/visibility. The sim is bit-identical
  regardless of equipped cosmetics — two players with different skins compute the same
  world.
- **No tell tampering.** A skin must not suppress, fake, or alter any "embodied unit"
  tell. If [Q2](open-questions.md) lands on the marked-hero option, that marker is
  engine-owned — skins render *under* it, never over it.
- **Out-of-band loadout.** Cosmetic choice travels as a non-sim-affecting tag alongside
  player identity/entitlements, **never** as sim state in the lockstep order stream. A
  peer missing a skin asset falls back to the default model with zero sim divergence.

**Consequences:**
- Validates the planned **accounts + entitlements** backend (and the Stripe hint in the
  infra scaffolding): purchases map to per-account cosmetic entitlements, resolved at
  load and applied in the render layer only.
- Asset-pipeline load: cosmetic variants are extra cooked assets under the mobile
  texture/download budget (ASTC/atlas discipline — see `architecture.md` §asset
  pipeline). Skins are the first real content-volume driver; budget for them.
- Opens a **new billing-rails fork → [Q9](open-questions.md):** mobile-first means
  digital cosmetics on iOS/Android generally **must** route through Apple StoreKit /
  Google Play Billing (platform IAP policy + revenue share), so Stripe/Steam apply only
  to desktop/web storefronts. Which rails per platform — and whether entitlements unify
  across them — is undecided.

## D14 — Phase 0 control prototype passes; touch-feel risk retired

**Resolves:** [Q4](open-questions.md) — the touch-control product risk (the project's #1
non-engine risk).

**Decision:** The Phase 0 control prototype is a **pass.** The embody↔command loop feels
good in hand on a touchscreen, validated hands-on on real hardware (Samsung Galaxy S24,
SM-S921U1). The risk that *CoH*-style command **plus** a competent FPS scheme **plus** an
instant swap between them couldn't be made to feel good on a small touchscreen is
**retired.** Greenlight to proceed past Phase 0 — the next gate is the **Phase 0.5**
embodiment-over-network latency spike ([`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md)), *not* Phase 1 engine
work.

**What was tested:** a throwaway **Godot 4.6** build (`prototypes/phase0-controls/`,
explicitly disposable — **not** the engine; the real engine is Rust/`wgpu` per D10, built
fresh at Phase 1). It modelled **feel only** and stayed faithful to the locked design: one
unit; tap-to-move literal-executor command layer (D3) with drag-pan and pinch-zoom;
**embody = swap the same entity's input source + flip vision to avatar-only**, no
character/respawn system (invariant #5, D6/D7); world-goes-dark with a constant vignette +
"BLIND" tell and **alerts-not-intel** (directional banner + haptic buzz, never a map
reveal — §6/D7); embodied scheme = left-thumb virtual stick, right-drag look, FIRE
hitscan, instant SURFACE.

**Why this is enough to proceed:** Phase 0's sole job per the roadmap was to answer *"does
the embody↔command loop feel good in hand?"* before building any systems. On a real device
the answer is yes — the control scheme and the instant swap, the two things that *had* to
feel right, do. The existential framing Q4 carried ("if it isn't fun in hand, the concept
reworks or dies here") is settled in the concept's favour. Detailed shipping touch UI
(multi-unit selection, the full order/stance vocabulary surfaced on a touchscreen) is
downstream Phase 2 design work, not a reopening of this question.

**Caveats carried forward (on the record, not blockers):**
- **Audio is still unproven.** The prototype faked it with haptics + visuals, but D7/§6
  make audio a *primary* system for going-dark — "hear your empire when you can't see it."
  The full blind-but-hearing feel is not validated until real audio exists; revisit before
  Phase 0 is considered fully closed.
- **Single-unit and local only.** The prototype cannot surface the *next* risk — embodied
  FPS feel **over** lockstep + input-delay netcode (Q7/Q8). That is exactly what Phase 0.5
  exists to answer, before the engine spine is committed.
- **Throwaway.** Keep `prototypes/phase0-controls/` as a reference artifact through Phase
  0.5, then delete it. It carries none of the engine invariants (fixed-point sim, PAL
  boundary, sim/render split) by design — do not grow it into the game.

**Consequence:** the next concrete step is the Phase 0.5 latency spike (two networked
clients, one embodied unit each, real input delay at the real 30 Hz tick), which must clear
before the Rust engine spine (Phase 1) is committed.

---

## D15 — Embodied combat over lockstep: avatar-local prediction (Phase 0.5 passes)

**Resolves:** [Q7](open-questions.md) (netcode model for embodied combat). Advances —
but does **not** close — [Q8](open-questions.md) (tick rate).

**Decision:** Embodied first-person combat rides the deterministic lockstep + input-delay
netcode **with avatar-local prediction**: the client predicts *only the player's own
embodied entity* locally and reconciles it against the authoritative tick, while everything
else stays pure lockstep. The Phase 0.5 latency spike **passes** — with prediction on,
embodied 1v1 combat feels good across every tested connection quality (up to a simulated
"cellular, worst" preset); with prediction off (raw lockstep + input delay) it feels laggy.
Greenlight the **Phase 1** engine spine.

**Why:** Phase 0.5 existed to prove embodied feel over the **RTS-optimal / FPS-hostile**
netcode *before* committing the engine (see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) §"Embodied
combat over lockstep", roadmap). The spike — phone (host) vs laptop (client) over real
Wi-Fi, with a tunable RTT/jitter/loss injector — showed prediction delivers responsive aim
and movement in every condition while raw lockstep does not. This **confirms the prior
lean**: predict the one entity you're twitch-controlling, keep the ~200-unit sim on pure
lockstep, and the deterministic core stays intact.

**Hard rule for Phase 1 (non-negotiable):** the prediction lives in the
**presentation/input path only** and must **never feed back into deterministic sim state**,
or it desyncs lockstep silently. Authoritative hit resolution and the remote view still
resolve at tick **T+D** inside the fixed-point sim. The prediction/reconciliation boundary
must be designed in from the **first netcode commit** — retrofitting it into a finished sim
is far costlier, which is the entire reason this spike preceded Phase 1.

**Q8 (tick rate) — still open, leaning hold-30 Hz.** The harness ran at 30 Hz by default
and prediction made it feel good in all conditions, so "hold 30 Hz, lean on prediction"
remains the lean. But the 30↔60 Hz toggle was **not** A/B'd in this pass, so 30 Hz is *not*
yet rigorously confirmed — **close Q8 early in Phase 1.**

**Caveats (on the record, not blockers):**
- The harness is throwaway and uses **floats** — it is **not** a determinism test; Phase
  1's fixed-point sim is still unproven (invariant #1 stands).
- 1v1 over LAN/Wi-Fi with an **idle opponent** — remote-avatar motion under jitter/loss
  driven by a *second human* was not stress-tested.
- **Audio still faked** (carry-forward from D14); the going-dark audio feel remains unproven.

**Consequences:**
- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) §"Embodied combat over lockstep" flips from *open
  tension* to a **settled approach** (avatar-local prediction + the presentation-path-only
  rule). The determinism checklist gains the "prediction never writes sim state" guard.
- Phase 0.5 is **done** in the roadmap; **Phase 1 (Rust engine spine) is unblocked.**
- Both throwaway prototypes (`prototypes/phase0-controls`, `prototypes/phase0.5-netfeel`)
  have served their purpose and may be deleted (or kept briefly as reference).
